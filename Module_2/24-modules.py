""" In Python, a module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. 

The file name is the module name with the suffix ".py" appended to it.

When you import a module, you can access its functions, classes, and variables in your program.

Here's an example of a simple module named my_module.py:
# my_module.py
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

pi = 3.14159

In the example above, my_module.py contains two functions, add() and subtract(), and a variable pi. To use these functions and variable in another Python file, you can import the module as follows:
