"""
There are main two types of loop in python.They are
1. for loops and
2. while loops
A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable object.
A while loop is used to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is met.

"""
# Examples
# The for loop will execute the code block for each item in the sequence.
for number in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    print(number)
"""
This will list the numbers 1 through 5 on separate lines.
"""
# The while loop will continue to execute the code block as long as the condition is True. For example:
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
"""
This will list the numbers 0 through 4 on separate lines.
