"""
In Python, variable naming conventions are guidelines for choosing the names of your variables. There are a few commonly used conventions:

Variables should be in lowercase, with words separated by underscores. For example: my_variable, student_name

Variables should be descriptive and meaningful. For example, instead of using "x" or "temp", use "student_name" or "temperature_in_fahrenheit".

Variables should not start with a number. For example, "3rd_student" is not a valid variable name, but "third_student" is.

Variables should not use any special characters except for underscores. For example, "student-name" is not a valid variable name, but "student_name" is.

Variables should not use Python keywords as variable name. For example, "if" or "else" cannot be used as variable names.

Example:

"""
#Good variable name
student_name = "John"
student_age = 25

#Bad variable name
3rd_student = "John"
student-name = "John"
if = "John"

# It is important to follow these conventions in order to make your code readable and easy to understand for others.
