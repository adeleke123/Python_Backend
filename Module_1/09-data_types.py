"""
In Python, a datatype is a category of data that determines what kind of value a variable can hold and how it can be used. Here are some common datatypes in Python and examples of how to use them:
"""
# String: A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. For example:

name = "Muideen Adeleke"
address = '123 Main St'
print(name) # Muideen Adeleke
print(address) # 123 Main St
print(type(name)) # <class 'str'>

# Integer: An integer is a whole number without a decimal point. For example:

age = 25
num_of_students = 30
print(age) # 25
print(num_of_students) # 30
print(type(num_of_students)) # <class 'int'>

# Float: A float is a decimal number. For example:

price = 19.99
distance = 3.14
print(price) # 19.99
print(distance) # 3.14
print(type(price))

# Boolean: A boolean value can be either True or False. For example:

is_student = True
is_valid = False
print(is_student)
print(is_valid)
print(type(is_valid))

# Dictionary: A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. For example:

student = {'name': 'John Smith', 'age': 25, 'address': '123 Main St'}

print(student)
print(type(student)

# Set: A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. For example:

Set = {1, 2, 3, 4}
print(Set)
print(type(Set))

Tuple: A tuple is an ordered collection of elements. For example:
student_info = ('John Smith', 25, '123 Main St')
print(student_info)
print(type(student_info))

# It is important to use the appropriate datatype for your variables, as it can affect how your code works and how data is stored and processed.
